This is the Text::Metaphone module with shared libraries compiled for 
MacPerl.  Shared libraries run only on PPC and CFM68K versions, not 
non-CFM 68K versions.

This was compiled with MPW and Codewarrior.  Passed all tests.  
I have no 68K machine so I can't test the CFM68K version.  Let me 
know of any problems.

I had to change the file "metaphone.c" to the name "metaphone_c.c",
and changed the Makefile.PL accordingly, since Mac OS filesystems
are not case-sensitive.

Also, see the MMP page:

    http://pudge.net/mmp/

Best installed using cpan-mac, either with the CPAN shell,
or the installme droplet.  From the CPAN shell, type:

    cpan> install CNANDOR/Text-Metaphn-1.95-bin-1-Mac.tgz

NAME

Text::Metaphone - A modern soundex.  Phonetic encoding of words.


SYNOPSIS

  use Text::Metaphone;
  $phoned_words = Metaphone('Schwern');
  

DESCRIPTION

C<Metaphone()> is a function whereby a string/word is broken down into
a rough approximation of its english phonetic pronunciation.  Very
similar in concept and purpose to soundex, but much more
comprehensive in its approach.
